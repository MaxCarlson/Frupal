CS300 HW, Kingdom of Frupal
# Group 5

1 To Compile:
         - The game is compiled by running Make

2 To Run: 
        - The game run just by running ./frupal

3 Demonstration: 
        * At least one map file for your game. This map should be winnable and demonstrate all the features of the game * (confused)

4 Instruction: 
        - Instructions for how to play the game, to the extent that gameplay is non-obvious.
        - Must choose one of the option at the start screen main menu: 
            * 1. Start The Game
            * 2. Select Map Seed
            * 3. Quit
        - Upon the obvious choice of option one: the player is given two set of keys to work with, a player itself ('@') and an independent
        - cursor (' '). The player can be toggled with the arrows to move into all the obvious directions and cursor can independently 
        - move throughout the map with its respective keys to all directions i.e: 1, 2, 3, 4 (these are obvious on the screen). 
        - Upon running into an item: the player must select 'Y' to purchase an item and 'N' to pass on an item. 
        - Win: Lastly a player wins when runnings buying a diamond.  
        - Dies: Player can die if runs out of energy as shown on the screen.
        - Press q for quitting the game at any time.  

        - Cursor: 
            - The cursor is independent and can go into the map areas which are not 'discovered' therefore, 
            - the dialogue box with a description of an grovnik and its contents is displayed in the in-game menu when
            - it is discovered. 

5 Discussion:
        - A brief discussion of what features you managed to implement, and any you didn't finish.
        - We were given mainly three Stretch Goals as part of the instructions for this project. We were able to achieve all of them.
        - Yet, some were more challenging than the others. Even though we used the mapgenerator to get the random generation of the map, 
        - It came with its challenges specially when it was integrated with the third stretch goal. 
        - We finished all the requirments for the viewport screen. We displayed on the screen where each grovnik occupies one character.
        - Implementing screen was also challenging at first as if the cursor went out of the bound or the UI did not fit into the alloted
        - right hand corner, the game would break, however we were able to successfully implement these features and make them work as the
        - fully functioning commands in instructions above. Lastly as described in the instructions and shown in our trailer, our entire 
        - game is working without any errors which means were able to implement all the features according to the requirments of the game.
